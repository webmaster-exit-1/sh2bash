# Sh2Bash

* TLDR: It changes `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/bin/bash` recursively. Mostly useful for Fish Shell users.

### How to use:

```bash
bash fix-shebang.sh
~~or~~
sudo bash fix-shebang.sh
```
* When prompted by the script, enter the full path to the directory where you would find files with #!/bin/sh: $HOME/Foo/Bar or /foo or .bar
* And you're done.
